/**
 * Route contracts, and nothing else. Pure Kotlin — zero Android, zero Compose.
 *
 * This module exists so that a feature can navigate to another feature's screen without
 * depending on it. Both sides know only the `@Serializable` route class declared here; the
 * feature that owns the screen registers it, the feature that wants it constructs it.
 *
 * Nothing that renders, holds state, or knows a `NavController` belongs here. If a route needed
 * a domain model as an argument, that would be a signal the two screens should be exchanging an
 * id instead.
